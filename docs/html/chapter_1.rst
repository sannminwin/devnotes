Introduction
------------

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard developed over the years to convey information over the internet by using "hyperlinks" - or just links as we know them today. As opposed to a PDF, an HTML page is much more dynamic in nature, letting you browse the web by clicking on links and interacting with the page. Links could take you either to a different location within the current page, or to a different page over the internet.

The last version of HTML is HTML 5.0, which has a LOT more capabilities than what the web originally had in mind. HTML 5 is an extremely comprehensive platform that allows creating a high-end user interface together with the power of CSS and JavaScript.
